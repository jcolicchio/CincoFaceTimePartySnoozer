Instructions
------------ 
1. Just add this file to your Messages' AppleScript folder
  * Typically `/Users/ttargus/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.iChat`
2. Open Messages preferences, ya dingus!
3. Select this script as AppleScript Handler at the bottom of the General Settings page
4. Set your status to "Not Sleeping" to activate Cinco's patented Quall-Core Response Generator. Great job!

Note: Messages will not auto-reply in any actively focused window. You should open any other program or leave your buddy list as the active window.
